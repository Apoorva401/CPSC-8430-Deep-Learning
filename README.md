# Deep Learning Course (CPSC 8430) Homework Projects

This repository contains all of my homework projects for the Deep Learning course (8430). The projects involve various deep learning concepts and techniques, primarily using the following technologies:

- **Python 3**
- **PyTorch**

## Homework Assignments

### HW1:

#### P1 - Deep vs Shallow:
1. Simulate a function.
2. Train on actual tasks using shallow and deep models.

#### P2 - Optimization:
1. Visualize the optimization process.
2. Observe the gradient norm during training.
3. Study what happens when the gradient is almost zero.

#### P3 - Generalization:
1. Network's Capacity to Fit Random Labels
2. Parameters vs Generalization
3. Exploring Flatness vs Generalization:
   - Part 1
   - Part 2

### HW2:Video caption generation

This project aims to create a system that automatically generates captions for short videos, describing their content. It uses a type of artificial intelligence called a sequence-to-sequence model to process the video and produce a series of words that form the caption.Here,result is evaluated with the BLEU score.
